        <p>This webpage was made as a showcase of skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the pursuit of a job.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started this project with 0 knowledge on any of the programming languages I used during this process, so everything was a learning experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I learned most of what I used for this project from books that cover HTML, CSS, and Javascript, written by Jon Duckett.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I encountered so many issues when making this from scratch, most having to deal with the storage and transfer of objects in relation to students and their classes/GPA through arrays.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By no means is this an optimal project as I think my 700 lines of Javascript could be condensed into the 400-500 range by an experienced user, however, this is a massive improvement from where I started with not knowing how to insert an HTML element into a document.</p>
